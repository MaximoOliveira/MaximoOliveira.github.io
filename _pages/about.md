Hi, IÂ´m Max! I graduated in Computer Science from the University of Lisbon, where I researched Automated Bug Fixing under the supervision of [Alcides Fonseca](https://alcidesfonseca.com/). Our [work](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3524459.3527345) was published at [APR 2022](https://program-repair.org/workshop-2022/). Now, I focus on backend development in the fintech industry, using my skills to build efficient and scalable systems.
