Hi there, IÂ´m Max! I graduated in Computer Science from the University of Lisbon where I also conducted research on Automated Bug Fixing under the supervision of [Alcides Fonseca](https://alcidesfonseca.com/). [Our work](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3524459.3527345) was published in the 3rd International Workshop on Automated Program Repair (APR 2022). Currently, I specialise in backend development within the fintech industry, leveraging my skills to create efficient and scalable systems.
